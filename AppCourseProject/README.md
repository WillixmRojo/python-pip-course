# Game Project

To run the project, you have to follow the next instructions in the terminal:

```sh
cd AppCourseProject
python3 main.py
```

You can then select an option depending on how you want to visualize the data:

1.- Graph of the population through time of specific countries.

2.- Pie chart of the percentage of world population of all the countries.

Each option will save an image of the visualization in the folder called imgs.
